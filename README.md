# Between Print and Manuscript: Browsing the Bookshops in Paul's Cross Churchyard
This project involves updating a research project looking at bookselling in Paulâ€™s Cross Churchyard in sixteenth-century England. You can see the current project website here: https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/BOOK2.htm

Students will make this archivally-based mapping project newly accessible and available. The project involves three main components: developing and regularizing metadata, transcribing and encoding documents, and developing XML-aware searches to bring forward patterns within the data.
